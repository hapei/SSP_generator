# Star Factory
Producing Simple Stellar Populations from Isochrones of the PARSEC-COLIBRI model including HST photometry uncertainties!

To install:  pip install SSP_generator


Input isochrones:
This code is only compatible with PARSEC isochrones (http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/cgi-bin/cmd). 

The uncertainty:
If you choose uncertainty==True, the code will generate stars with observational photometry uncertainties of HST considering your choice of S/N for a specific magnitudes!
